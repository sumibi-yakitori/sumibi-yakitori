### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Japanese software developer, and I write English with the help of DeepL Translator.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

- I develop business software and indie games.
  - **These days, I spend more time writing stories and pixel art than writing code.**
- I do most of my work in a secret Git server. so those activities don't show up in my GitHub account activities.
  - The development of the game itself has been slow, but I've been using RustðŸš€, [tui](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs), [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) and [tetra](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra) to create several in-house tools, some of which are listed below.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

  - I would be happy to have a friend who can work with me to create a beautiful, minimalist game that I am really looking for.
Preferably someone who prefers 2D indie games.
  - I am currently working on a very old-fashioned JRPG. I'd be happy to get to know people who are interested in writing pixel art, [landscape design for locations and dungeons, level design, story writing](https://minahito.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/planner-one-of-disciplines-in-japanese-video-game-industory/), localization, etc., as well as engineers.
  - If you want money, I may be able to introduce you to remote work. But that may not be game development. I also like to develop business software.
  - I haven't had much time to play games lately, but these are some of the games that I have liked.
      - Splatoon 2
      - BotW
      - Celeste
      - Undertale
      - FTL
      - Risk of Rain
      - VA-11 Hall-A
      - Katana ZERO
      - Cave story
      - etc..

  ã€€ã€€ My career as a game player started with the Famicom (NES), so I have played a lot of old Japanese games. Therefore, there are many games from that era that I like very much.
    

### ðŸ‘» Strange fact:

- Unusually for a programmer, I have also worked as an artist for Japanese game companies.
  - This is a model of a character that may appear in my game, She is a pathetic girl who has been neglected since she was created because the creator is caught up in programming and daily life events.
