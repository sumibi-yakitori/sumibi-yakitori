### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Japanese software engineer, and I write English with the help of DeepL Translator.

**ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...**

- I develop business software and indie games.
  - **These days, I spend more time writing stories and pixel art than writing code.**
- I do most of my work in a secret Git server. so those activities don't show up in my GitHub account activities.


**ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...**

  - I would be happy to have a friend who can work with me to create a beautiful, minimalist game that I am really looking for.
Preferably someone who prefers 2D indie games.
  - What I am currently working on is a JRPG. I'd be happy to get to know people who are interested in writing pixel art, landscape design for dungeons and locations, level design, localization, etc., as well as engineers.
  - If you want money, I may be able to introduce you to remote work. But that may not be game development. I also prefer to develop business software.
  - I haven't had much time to play games lately, but these are some of the games that I have liked.
      - Splatoon2
      - Celeste
      - Undertale
      - Katana ZERO

  ã€€ã€€My gaming career started with the Famicom (NES), so I have played a lot of old Japanese games. So there are many games from that era that I like very much.
    

**âš¡ Fun fact:**
  - Unusually for a programmer, I have also worked as an artist for Japanese game companies.
