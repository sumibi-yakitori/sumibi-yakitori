## Replacing HID switches

The circuits to which switches are soldered are likely to be through-holes.
If those hard-to-remove switches are heated for a long time using a desoldering wick, the land will be heated and easily damaged.

Therefore, as far as possible, use the FR-301[^DesolderingToolVideo][^FR-410] and a suitable nozzle to suck out the solder.

### Trackballs

**ELECOM IST (M-IT11DRBK)**

![IST](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714XRz6oGSL._AC_SL200_.jpg)

This product uses bearings in the trackball support mechanism. However, all button switches are heavy.
The heavy clicking of the main switches in particular leads to discomfort and fatigue as the time of use increases,
so it is advisable to replace these switches first and foremost.
