## Replacing HID switches

The circuits to which switches are soldered are likely to be through-holes.
If those hard-to-remove switches are heated for a long time using a desoldering wick, the land will be heated and easily damaged.

Therefore, as far as possible, use the FR-301[^DesolderingToolVideo][^FR-410] and a suitable nozzle to suck out the solder.

[^DesolderingToolVideo]: [Instructional videos on how to use the system do not exist on the Japanese language pages.](https://hakkousa.com/products/desoldering/desoldering-tools/fr-301-portable-desoldering-tool.html)

- The main switch is optical and is said to prevent chattering,
  but the clicking sound is light and cheap but not that unpleasant.
- Side buttons are large and easy to press.

### Others

**ELECOM M-CAD01UBBK**

![M-CAD01UBBK](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xStNk1RFL._AC_SL200_.jpg)
- It has OMRON micro switches.
- It does not feel bad to hold.
- Some DCC tool operations also require both a middle button click and wheel operation,
  so if you have the time to replace the switch on a regular mouse to create the ideal mouse,
  I recommend you take that route.





### Trackballs

**ELECOM IST (M-IT11DRBK)**

![IST](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714XRz6oGSL._AC_SL200_.jpg)

This product uses bearings in the trackball support mechanism. However, all button switches are heavy.
The heavy clicking of the main switches in particular leads to discomfort and fatigue as the time of use increases,
so it is advisable to replace these switches first and foremost.

| Button         | Original parts              | Replacement parts        |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Left           | Kailh black body/red axis   | [OMRON D2F-01F][D2F-01F] |
